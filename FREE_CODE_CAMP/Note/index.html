    <h1>Basic Node and Express - Start a Working Express Server</h1>

    In the first two lines of the file myApp.js, you can see how easy it is to
    create an Express app object. This object has several methods, and you will
    learn many of them in these challenges. One fundamental method is
    app.listen(port). It tells your server to listen on a given port, putting it
    in running state. For testing reasons, we need the app to be running in the
    background so we added this method in the `server.js` file for you. Letâ€™s
    serve our first string! In Express, routes takes the following structure:
    app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER). METHOD is an http method in lowercase. PATH is a
    relative path on the server (it can be a string, or even a regular
    expression). HANDLER is a function that Express calls when the route is
    matched. Handlers take the form function(req, res) {...}, where req is the
    request object, and res is the response object. For example, the handler
